**App name:** Adblock Fast

**Short description:**

Adblock Fast is a faster, open-source ad blocker for Samsung Internet 4.0+.

**Full description:**

You can now block ads without rooting your device or switching browsers<i>!</i>

Adblock Fast runs optimized filtering rules to accelerate webpages more but consume less CPU,
memory, and storage than other ad blockers do. Also unlike other ad blockers, Adblock Fast doesn’t
allow “acceptable ads” and never will.

<b>The app requires and blocks ads in Samsung Internet 4.0 and up. After installing, follow the
in-app directions to turn blocking on.</b>

We use a public content-blocking API that’s provided by Samsung Internet:
